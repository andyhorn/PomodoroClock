Pomorodo Clock
==============
### What is it?
A Pomodoro Clock is, essentially, a cyclical timer that alternates between a 'work' 
session and a 'break' session. It is used to manage your time during the work day to 
help alleviate stress and fatigue and prevent burnout.

### How does it work?
It's very simple! The default settings should work just fine for most people, so just 
open the app and click the start button!

It will begin with a 25 minute 'work' session, after which it will switch to a 5 minute 
'break' session, which will return to the 'work' session and so on. This helps break up 
your work day into smaller, more manageable chunks.

### Settings
There are a few settings that can be changed on-the-fly. These can all be accessed by 
clicking the gear icon that floats in the top-right of your screen.
- Alarm
- Volume
- Continuity

##### Alarm
The alarm is a simple, audible beep that will play at the end of each session. 

##### Volume
If the alarm is enabled, this will change the volume. The default setting is 33%, which 
is more than loud enough for me to hear through my headphones over my music or podcasts 
(it's a pretty loud source file). 

##### Continuity (Continuous Timer)
Checking this box will allow the clock to automatically begin counting down the next 
session when it switches over. The default setting is OFF, which causes the timer to 
pause at the end of a session. This works because it allows you to wrap-up whatever 
immediate tasks you have before starting your break, or allows you to get situated 
before starting the next work session.

# ENJOY!
